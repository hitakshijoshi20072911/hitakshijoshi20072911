# Hi, I'm Hits 👋

I’m a **tech enthusiast**, problem-solver, and builder who enjoys turning ideas into functional, scalable software.  
Currently pursuing **B.Tech in Information Technology**, I actively explore **full-stack development, backend systems, and applied AI**, learning through hands-on projects, hackathons, and open-source contributions.

I believe in learning by building, breaking, and rebuilding — focusing on real-world impact rather than just theory.
